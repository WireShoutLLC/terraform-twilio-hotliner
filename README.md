# terraform-twilio-hotliner

This module is used to set up a Twilio phone number for use with [Hotliner](https://hotliner.me/) using the [Twilio terraform provider](https://github.com/twilio/terraform-provider-twilio).

Note: The Twilio provider for terraform is not in a stable state and not considered production ready. This module is reliant on that provider, so please take that into consideration.
